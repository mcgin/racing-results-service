# To do
Use facories in the tests to create the objects
Alot of overlap between RPRemoteHorseService & RPRemoteCourseService should be refactored
Expand the horse service to return more than just name and id - likely to mean findByName uses findById to get full details
Expand the course service to return more than just name and id - likely to mean findByName uses findById to get full details
